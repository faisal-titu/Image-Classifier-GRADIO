# Image Classification with InceptionV3 and Gradio

This repository hosts a Python application that demonstrates image classification using TensorFlow's InceptionV3 model and Gradio for creating an interactive web interface. Users can upload images, and the application will classify them into one of the 1000 classes based on the ImageNet dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have a `Windows/Linux/Mac` machine with Python 3.6+ installed.
* You are familiar with Python and virtual environments.

## Installation

### Clone the repository and set up the environment

First, clone the repository to your local machine and set up a virtual environment by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For MacOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application using the following command:

```
python app.py
```

After running the command, navigate to the URL provided by Gradio in your web browser to interact with the image classification model.

## Documentation

### Modules

- `inception_model.py`: Contains the logic for loading the InceptionV3 model and handling image classification.
- `app.py`: The main script that launches the Gradio interface.

### Functions

- `classify_image(inp)`: Takes an input image, processes it, and returns classification results using the InceptionV3 model.

### Inputs and Outputs

- **Input**: An image file uploaded through the Gradio interface.
- **Output**: The top 5 predicted labels from the ImageNet dataset.
